# K1 Max LiDAR (Creality "AI LiDAR") for Kalico
#
# The LiDAR is a line-laser height sensor on the toolhead: one capture is a
# ~29mm wide height profile (~1500 points, in um) across X. Creality's
# cx_ai_middleware (started by lidar-start.sh) drives it and answers JSON
# requests on a unix socket; this plugin moves the toolhead and collects the
# profiles, so scans can run inside a print.
#
# The K1 has ~200MB of RAM and a slow CPU, and a heavy job starves Klipper
# (MCU "Rescheduled timer in the past"). So everything is reduced while
# scanning: each stop becomes one averaged profile of 580 bins (0.05mm), and
# the analysis is plain Python done a few rows at a time.
#
#   [lidar]
#   x_offset: -36       # laser line centre relative to the nozzle,
#   y_offset: -21.2     #   with the nozzle offset_z above the surface
#   #x_per_z: 0         # how far the spot moves per mm of nozzle height
#   #y_per_z: 0         #   (the laser hits at an angle)
#   #offset_z: 3
#   x_dir: -1           # profile x runs towards printer -X
#   LIDAR_OFFSET_CALIBRATE saves its result as lidar_x_offset, lidar_y_offset,
#   lidar_x_per_z, lidar_y_per_z (variables.cfg); they override these
#   #service: 10.0.1.34:7131   # optional: lidar_service.py on a helper

#   LIDAR_SCAN NAME= X= Y0= Y1= [STEP=0.4] [Z=3] [MODE=dwell|stop]
#       [CAPTURES=3] [LEVEL=scan_level]
#       X/Y are where the laser looks (not the nozzle); one profile per Y.
#       dwell (default with a service): rows planned just ahead and locked
#       to the LiDAR's frames, one frame per row taken standing still (one
#       frame period per row); stop: stop at every row and average CAPTURES
#       frames (slower, ~1.3s per row)
#   LIDAR_TIMING [Z=3] [DZ=1.5] [SPEED=5] [CYCLES=15] [LEVELS=0,1] [APPLY=1]
#       measures the frame period and the time window a frame covers before
#       it arrives, for the current driver (slow Z moves over a flat plate
#       at the current X/Y), and saves them for dwell scans (lidar_timing).
#       Run again after LIDAR_DRIVER

#       [LINES=9] [X=130] [Y=100]
#       writes the PA test as a print and starts it: START_PRINT (with the
#       bare-plate scan after the nozzle touch, before the purge), the test
#       lines, cool down, scan, analysis, END_PRINT
#   LIDAR_OFFSET_CALIBRATE EXTRUDER_TEMP= BED_TEMP= [X=150] [Y=150]
#       [Z1=3] [Z2=5] [APPLY=1]
#       prints a small cross (nozzle at X/Y = its centre), scans it at Z1
#       and Z2 and works out where the laser looks: X/Y offset and how far
#       it moves per mm of height. Run directly, nothing in the job list
#   LIDAR_PA_CREALITY EXTRUDER_TEMP= BED_TEMP= [X=170] [Y=60]

#       Creality's own PA test pattern (frame, flow boxes, four zig-zags,

#       the gantry tips the toolhead forward/back by an amount that changes

#       height (~0.2mm across the bed, 2026-10-29). At spots along X the
#       nozzle touches the bed (load cells), then the laser looks at the same
#       spot: LiDAR - nozzle is saved as lidar_twist for LIDAR_BED_MESH.
#       Also logs the LiDAR distance with the nozzle on the bed
#       (lidar_zero_log, data only). Wrapped by LIDAR_TWIST_CALIBRATION
